# DSL for educational games
 Using Meta Programming System to create domain-specific languages for educational games
 
## Preparation:
Followed [Fast Track to MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/2019.3/fast-track-to-mps.html) and created several learning projects from scratch.
Based minesweeper implementation on [Zetcode Java Minesweeper tutorial](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/minesweeper/).

## Product:
A MPS Solution which contains defined languages for game creation and a sandbox for educational games with varying difficulties.

## Installation instructions:
1. Download and install [MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/) for your Operating System.
2. [Clone](https://github.com/Tristanas/DSL-for-educational-games.git) this repository or [download](https://github.com/Tristanas/DSL-for-educational-games/archive/master.zip) its source. If you download the project from this link, you will need to extract it from the archive.  Extract the archive near your root folder, to avoid possible errors while extracting due to maximum path length.
3. Copy the path to where the downloaded and unzipped project is located.
4. Run MPS, select "Open Project" and either locate the project folder or paste the path. Select the project and click "OK".
5. You may need to migrate the project. It's optional. You may select "Migrate" or "Postpone".
6. Right click on "EducationalGame" in the project view and select "Make Project". Wait for the build process to finish.

Once you follow these steps you may define your own questionaires, Minesweeper games, extend or modify existing languages and play the games. Games are located in the Minesweeper sandbox solution. Right click on a game and select "run node" to run it.
